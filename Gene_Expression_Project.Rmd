```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library('DESeq2')
library('PoiClaClu')
```

The count data is loaded into R.

Table 1: Raw counts data
```{r}
count_data <- "Sample_Subfields_Counts.txt"
counts <- read.table(file = count_data, header = TRUE)
head(counts)



dim(counts)
#str(counts)

control_CA1 <- c(1:13)
case_CA1 <- c(14:26)
control_CA3 <- c(27:39)
case_CA3 <- c(40:52)
control_DG <- c(53:65)
case_DG <- c(66:78)


counts_CA1 <- counts[, 1:26]
#counts_CA1
counts_CA3 <- counts[, 27:52]
#counts_CA3
counts_DG <- counts[, 53:78]
#counts_DG
```

The data of the counts was split based on the hippocampal subfield and tidied using tidyr (table 2-4).

Table 2: Tidy CA1 data
```{r}
counts_CA1_tidy <- pivot_longer(data = counts_CA1,
             cols=1:26,
             #names_pattern="(CA1_CTL|CA1_SZ).",
             names_to ="sample",
             values_to = "value")
head(counts_CA1_tidy)
```

Table 3: Tidy CA3 data
```{r}
counts_CA3_tidy <- pivot_longer(data = counts_CA3,
             cols=1:26,
             #names_pattern="(CA1_CTL|CA1_SZ).",
             names_to ="sample",
             values_to = "value")
head(counts_CA3_tidy)
```

Table 4: Tidy DG data
```{r}
counts_DG_tidy <- pivot_longer(data = counts_DG,
             cols=1:26,
             #names_pattern="(CA1_CTL|CA1_SZ).",
             names_to ="sample",
             values_to = "value")
head(counts_DG_tidy)
```


```{r}
counts_CA1_tidy$log2 <- log2(counts_CA1_tidy$value + 1)
counts_CA3_tidy$log2 <- log2(counts_CA3_tidy$value + 1)
counts_DG_tidy$log2 <- log2(counts_DG_tidy$value + 1)

ggplot(data = counts_CA1_tidy, mapping = aes(x = sample, y = log2))+
geom_boxplot()+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))

sums <- colSums(counts_CA1)/1e6
CA1_sequence_depth = data.frame(sample=names(sums), depth=sums)
CA1_sequence_depth %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sample, y=sums)) + geom_col() +
   scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))

ggplot(data = counts_CA3_tidy, mapping = aes(x = sample, y = log2))+
geom_boxplot()+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))



ggplot(data = counts_DG_tidy, mapping = aes(x = sample, y = log2))+
geom_boxplot()+
scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90))
```

The data is separated in control and case groups for each subfield and visualized by creating a boxplot for each group (figure 1-6).

```{r}

case_dg <- c(66:78)

par(cex = 0.8)
boxplot(log2(counts[control_ca1] + 1), outline = T, cex.names = 0.2, col = "green", las = 2)
```

A density plot is made for all the samples to visualize the distribution of the log2 of the count data.
```{r}
myColors <- hue_pal()(4)

plotDensity(log2(counts + 0.1), col=rep(myColors, each=3),
            lty=c(1:ncol(counts)), xlab='Log2(count)',
            main='Expression Distribution')

legend('topright', names(counts), lty=c(1:ncol(counts)),
       col=rep(myColors, each=3))
abline(v=-1.5, lwd=1, col='red', lty=2)
```

Barplots are created for each control and case group in which the total raw count is shown of each sample.
```{r}
barplot(colSums(counts[control_ca1]) / 1e6, col = "#D6F6DD", las = 2, cex.names = 0.8)
```

```{r}
#annotation <- data.frame(subfield = factor(rep(1:3, each = 26), 
 #                                         labels = c("CA1", "CA3", "DG")),
  #                       type = factor(rep(rep(1:2, each = 13), 3),
   #                                      labels = c("control", "schizophrenia")))
                         
# Set the rownames of the annotation dataframe to the sample names (required)
#rownames(annotation) <- names(counts)
```

The data is annotated in a dataframe with names containing control and case samples, and whether the case samples were derived from subjects on or off medication. This also enabled the identification of the sample types.
```{r}
load("annotation.RData")
```

Several DESeq2 functions are utilized to transform the raw read count data and calculating sample distances. A DESeqDataSet is made using the count data and the annotation which consists of the sample names.
```{r}
(ddsMat <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                                  colData = data.frame(samples = names(counts)),
                                  design = ~ 1))

# Perform normalization
#rld.dds <- vst(ddsMat)
# 'Extract' normalized values
#rld <- assay(rld.dds)
#sampledists <- dist( t( rld ))
#head(sampledists)
```

To visualize the calculated distances, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is done, which uses Poisson distances. These distances are calculated using PoiClaClu functions. To do this, the count data is extracted from the DESeq dataset using the assay function. The t-function is used to transpose the matrix of the values, and the Poisson distance is calculated using the PoissonDistance function, which also normalizes the data.
```{r}

# Note: uses the raw-count data, PoissonDistance performs normalization
# set by the 'type' parameter (uses DESeq)
dds <- assay(ddsMat)
poisd <- PoissonDistance( t(dds), type = "deseq")
# Extract the matrix with distances
samplePoisDistMatrix <- as.matrix(poisd$dd)
# Calculate the MDS and get the X- and Y-coordinates
mdsPoisData <- data.frame( cmdscale(samplePoisDistMatrix) )

# And set some better readable names for the columns
names(mdsPoisData) <- c('x_coord', 'y_coord')
```

The annotated data is separated into groups depending on whether the sample was obtained from a control or case subject, whether they were on or off medication, and the hippocampal subfield of interest (CA1, CA3 or DG). These groups were labeled accordingly and used to plot a graph showing the MDS data.
```{r}
groups <- factor(rep(1:6, each=13), 
                 labels = c("CA1_CTL", "CA1_SZ", "CA3_CTL", "CA3_SZ", "DG_CTL", "DG_SZ"))
coldata <- names(counts)

color_palette <- c("#D6F6DD", "#DAC4F7", "#CCCCCC", "#ACECF7", "#F4989C", "#EBD2B4")

# Create the plot using ggplot

  labs(x = "Poisson Distance", y = "Poisson Distance") +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(caption = "Figure: MDS plot")
```

A dataframe without sample CA3_CTL_0885 is made and the previous steps for the visualization in the MDS plot were repeated.
```{r}
count_nooutlier <- counts[ ,-38]
col1 <-rep(c("CA1", "CA3", "DG"), times = c(26, 25, 26))
col2 <-rep(c("control", "sz", "control", "sz", "control", "sz"), times = c(13, 13, 12, 13, 13, 13))
 
annotation_rm_ctl12 <- data.frame(col1, col2)
                        
rownames(annotation_rm_ctl12) <- names(count_nooutlier)
```

```{r}

The raw counts data was normalized again by calculating the fragments per million mapped fragments (FPM), this is equal to CPM (counts per million). The log2 was calculated of these given values. 
```{r}
counts.fpm <- log2( (counts / (colSums(counts) / 1e6)) + 1 )
```

A new group is made in the annotation data frame which contains information about the condition of the samples (control or schizophrenic), which hippocampal subfield is examined and whether the patient was on anti-psychotic medication or not. This is done to make it easier to compare these different groups.

Using DESeq a comparison is made between the schizophrenic patients who were on anti-psychotic medication and those who were not. A comparison is also made between the schizophrenia group off medication and the healthy control group of each subfield. These two comparisons are made for each hippocampal subfield using an adjusted p-value of 0.05. The results of these comparisons give information about the amount of genes that are up or down regulated.

```{r}
annotation$Group <- paste(annotation$Condition, annotation$Region, annotation$Drug, sep="_")
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = annotation,
                              design = ~ 0 + Group)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
resultsNames(dds)
res_CA1_drug <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_CA1_ON", "schizophrenia_CA1_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_CA1_drug)

res_CA1_SZ_CTL <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_CA1_OFF", "control_CA1_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_CA1_SZ_CTL)

res_CA3_drug <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_CA3_ON", "schizophrenia_CA3_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_CA3_drug)

res_CA3_SZ_CTL <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_CA3_OFF", "control_CA3_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_CA3_SZ_CTL)

res_DG_drug <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_DG_ON", "schizophrenia_DG_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_DG_drug)

res_DG_SZ_CTL <- results(dds, contrast = c("Group", "schizophrenia_DG_OFF", "control_DG_OFF"), alpha = 0.05)
summary(res_DG_SZ_CTL)
```

For each hippocampal subfield, a volcano plot is made using the results from DESeq to show the difference in gene expression between schizophrenic patient who were on medication and those who were not. In the volcano plot all genes are visualized but only the DEG's are highlighted. To determine which gene is a DEG, a threshold of 0.05 is set for the adjusted p-value and 2 for the fold-change (FC).
```{r}

```
Figure 16: Volcano plot showing the gene expression of subfield CA1 resulting from the comparison of patients on and off drugs
The expression values are plotted with the -log10 p-value on the y-axis and the log fold-change on the x-axis. The plot is separated into according to the set thresholds with a different color for each section. The grey area shows the genes with expressions below both thresholds, the green area shows the genes with expressions only above the FC threshold, the genes with only high p-values are shown in blue, and in red, the significant DEG's or the genes with expressions above both thresholds are shown.
